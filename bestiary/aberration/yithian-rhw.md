*Fungous Alien Body Swapper*

Yithians are cosmos-traveling scholars with distinctive, conical bodies and four limbs that end in pincers, sensory structures, and flute-like communication organs. They search for secrets to add to their vast libraries, conducting research by swapping minds with the inhabitants of other worlds—sometimes indefinitely. When a yithian swaps minds with a creature, it traps its victim's mind in the yithian's body, which it teleports to its unfathomable, alien home world.
