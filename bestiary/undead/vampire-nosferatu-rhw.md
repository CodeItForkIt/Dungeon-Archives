# [Vampire Nosferatu](/bestiary/undead/vampire-nosferatu-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 275*  

Nosferatu are vicious, feral hunters cursed with a primal offshoot of the curse of vampirism. These ravenous, graceless predators stalk the night, desperately seeking blood and barely remembered comforts of life.

Nosferatu feed on anything with blood. Heaps of mutilated rats, stables turned into slaughterhouses, and fields covered in massacred livestock might mark a nosferatu's presence. Nosferatu lurk in forgotten places scoured of the living, such as charnel caves, cursed ruins, and desecrated barrow mounds.

For a few moments after feeding, nosferatu become lucid enough to recollect glimpses of their past lives. Even in these instances, though, they remain duplicitous schemers.

## Vampires

*Monstrous Life Drinkers*

Horrific varieties of blood-drinking vampires spread their wickedness across the Domains of Dread.
