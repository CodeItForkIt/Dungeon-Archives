# [Jiangshi](/bestiary/undead/jiangshi-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 251*  

*Vindictive, Vitality-Sapping Corpse*

When a soul becomes trapped within its corpse, its bitterness can reanimate its body, creating a jiangshi. These vengeful dead stalk their descendants, sowing terror and taking retribution for the slights or neglected burial rites that led to their cursed resurrections. Rigor mortis notoriously afflicts the limbs of jiangshi, causing them to hold their arms rigidly and to walk with a stiff gait. This, along with their flight, leads many to call them hopping vampires.

By day, jiangshi lurk within tombs or hidden ruins to avoid attention from the living. At night, they emerge to drain the life from those who dare wander in darkness. A Humanoid killed by a jiangshi rises as a life-hungry corpse that, if given the chance to slake its thirst, might also turn into jiangshi.
