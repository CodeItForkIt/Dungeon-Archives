*Vampire Arcanist of the Nine Hells*

While mortal wizards tend to hesitate before bartering their souls to devils for magical power, vampire wizards often believe their immortality will exempt them from any infernal claim to their souls. The archdevil Mephistopheles happily exploits such hubris and proves that even undead aren't immune to the laws of the Nine Hells.

The greatest hell-bound vampires are masters of hellfire called infernalists, who prey on mages. Vampire infernalists are usually too arrogant to work together; even a large city isn't likely to harbor more than one vampire infernalist. Vampire infernalists are dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from the sun's searing rays before emerging at night to commit unsavory deeds.

## Vampire Infernalist Lairs

Vampire infernalists lurk in gloomy libraries or ritual chambers, far from the sun's light.
