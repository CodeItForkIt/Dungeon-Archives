James Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar wizarding family. Jim's arcane pedigree has long preceded him, incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps "that strange old man in the village," Jim's original penchant was not for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.

As an entertainer and purveyor of the "Jim Darkmagic Experience," the legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares, performing feats of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated. And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which point he hopes to become a "real wizard"-by which he means a fake wizard-full time.
