# [Lothar](/bestiary/npc/lothar-mabjov.md)
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 80*  

Lothar is an Uthgardt barbarian and priest of the Raven Queen. He was born to the Uthgardt tribe of the Black Raven. His mother left him to be raised by her Uthgardt husband when Lothar was still young. Lothar was struck with wanderlust an early age, both because of a desire to see the world and a chance to escape the superstition of his people. Lothar can sense paths that are [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#Invisible) to mortal senses. He can walk into a forest glade and emerge in the Feywild or track a stag through the snow to appear on the glacial fields of Elysium.

Eventually the wanderings of his youth took him into the Shadowfell. Unlike most, Lothar felt an affinity for the dread realm and had no desire to leave. In the years he spent there, he met his lifelong friend Borivik as well as coming into the service of the Raven Queen.

Unlike most faithful, Lothar's devotion to the Raven Queen was not something that came willingly. Lothar was infected with lycanthropy when he stayed with a family of wereravens disguised as simple merchants. Initially he searched for a cure to the supernatural affliction, but soon began to hear the whisperings of the Raven Queen. At first, she only spoke to him in his dreams, but her voice became more insistent as time went on. It was not long before her voice would encroach upon his thoughts day and night. Lothar realized that he could swear fealty to the enigmatic ruler of the Shadowfell or he could descend into madness. He chose the former.

Much like most who follow the Raven Queen, Lothar rarely understands her motivations or goals. It is his duty to find those he has seen in the visions that she sends him.

## Lothar as a Contact

Lothar is the primary contact for the Raven Circle at low levels. Lothar can take companions with him when he walks the paths between worlds. He will only take members of the Raven Circle on each unique journey once and he waits for one week before returning to Faerûn.
