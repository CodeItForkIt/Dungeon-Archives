## Valindra Shadowmantle

*Cold and Calculating Lich Wizard*

Valindra Shadowmantle was a selfish and ambitious high elf wizard who eschewed her community in search of arcane power in the wider world. Valindra has no compunctions about forming allies of convenience, and she's worked with Szass Tam and his Red Wizards of Thay, the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan, devil cultists, and more.

Although Valindra has the sunken pallor common to liches, she prefers to maintain a magical disguise that allows her to appear as the high elf she was in life. Ever the schemer, Valindra doesn't use this disguise out of nostalgia or regret, but to hide the powers she has since gained as an Undead creature.

## Valindra Shadowmantle's Lair

Valindra lairs within a sprawling, ruined library in the Shadowfell. After several disastrous confrontations with enemies of her temporary allies, she's elected to keep her personal lair secret. Deep within her lair is a hidden reading room where she usually keeps her spirit gem.

The region containing Valindra's lair is warped by her presence, creating the following effects:

- **All-Seeing.** While in her lair, Valindra can cast Clairvoyance, requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as her Spellcasting action.  
- **Apathy.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that aren't Undead have Disadvantage on [Death Saving Throws](/rules/variant-rules/death-saving-throw-xphb.md) and Initiative rolls.  
- **Thirst for Knowledge.** Within 1 mile of the lair, creatures have Advantage on Intelligence checks made when they take the Study action.  

If Valindra dies or moves her lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. These effects resume if Valindra gains a new body (see her Spirit Gem trait).
