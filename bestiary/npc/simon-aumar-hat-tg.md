# [Simon Aumar](/bestiary/npc/simon-aumar-hat-tg.md)
*Source: Honor Among Thieves: Thieves' Gallery*  

Simon Aumar suffers under the weight of his family name. Though he is a descendent of an elf and the legendary wizard Elminster Aumar, Simon's own sorcerous wild magic runs uncontrolled through his veins. Simon has not yet developed the ability to harness his power, and his spells explode or fizzle seemingly at random.

Though he's dogged by doubt, the brave young mage has earned his place in Edgin's crew. He performs best under pressure, instinctively unleashing his magic in dire moments. How he will continue to unlock his potential and what he will do with his volatile gift are yet to be seen.
