*Source: RHW p. 246*  

*Wandering Monster Hunter*

Ez d'Avenir first encountered monsters among her manipulative family, the Radanaviches, who posed as Vistani to prey on travelers. Among their foul deeds, the Radanavich family kidnapped Erasmus van Richten, the son of Rudolph van Richten and sold him to his death at the hands of the vampire Baron Metus. In the brief time Ez knew Erasmus, the youth spoke lovingly of a different sort of family than the one Ez knew. When Erasmus's father tracked down Ez's family and delivered her mother to justice, Ez didn't stop the determined doctor.

In the years that followed, Ez joined a true Vistani band and adopted the name d'Avenir. She traveled far but never found the sense of belonging Erasmus described. She sought out Rudolph van Richten and, after a wary introduction, came to study with the doctor. During that time, she reconnected with Erasmus, now a ghost. She learned priceless lessons from the van Richtens, but she eventually left their household to pursue her own destiny.

Ez's skillful slaying of monsters and her bravery in the face of supernatural perils have earned her a reputation as a folk hero and Mist wanderer of note. Although her adventures have cost her dearly—she has lost valuable bounties, dear companions, and her leg from the knee down—Ez works tirelessly to eradicate evil and protect innocents. Armed with wisdom from her mentor, encouragement from her departed friend, and hope forged in the depths of her heart, Ez aspires to someday create a place that feels safe enough to call home.

Whether she's hunting monsters or investigating mysteries, Ez carries Vistani music with her wherever she goes. She boasts a significant repertoire of songs from across the Land of the Mists, which she's happy to perform for anyone who travels alongside her.
