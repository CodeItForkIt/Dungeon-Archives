Noggles don't burglarize—they ransack. Still, despite their indiscretion, many noggles choose to wear masks, bandannas, or flimsy disguises to obscure their identities.

## Noggles

Noggles are bipedal, donkey-like Fey that delight in thievery and mischief. They enjoy stealing from other creatures not out of necessity, but out of principle. This principle can be summarized by a common Sylvan expression that roughly translates to "that's mine!" Noggles are found only in Shadowmoor, where they roam and cause chaos.
