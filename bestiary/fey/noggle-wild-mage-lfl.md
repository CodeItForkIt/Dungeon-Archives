# [Noggle Wild Mage](/bestiary/fey/noggle-wild-mage-lfl.md)
*Source: Lorwyn: First Light*  

Some noggles have a powerful connection to the strange magic that suffuses the realm of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor. Such wild mages exist on the peripheries of noggle society as pariahs and vagabonds. Their innate magic becomes strongest when they are most desperate, such as in the heat of battle.

## Noggles

Noggles are bipedal, donkey-like Fey that delight in thievery and mischief. They enjoy stealing from other creatures not out of necessity, but out of principle. This principle can be summarized by a common Sylvan expression that roughly translates to "that's mine!" Noggles are found only in Shadowmoor, where they roam and cause chaos.
