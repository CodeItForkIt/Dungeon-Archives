*Terrifying Monster of the Mists*

Unspeakable horrors are anathema to all other life in the multiverse. Their shapes change constantly in ways that defy and disrupt reality. Those who look on these beings instantly understand their absolute and awful wrongness. Such revelations are often the last witnesses have before they're dissolved by discordant, destructive forces.
