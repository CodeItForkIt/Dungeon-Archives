*Source: Lorwyn: First Light*  

Most Lorwyn merrow are Merrow Haranguers, who seek to overwhelm others with a glut of highly critical language to get their way.

## Merrow

Merrow are primarily water-dwelling people who exploit the realm of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor's land-dwelling species. They resemble large fish with humanoid torsos and arms, though their forms vary widely. Merrow are often capable warriors, but most prefer to duel with cutting words before resorting to physical violence.
