# [Decaton Modron](/bestiary/construct/decaton-modron-mpp.md)
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 36*  

The least of the hierarchs, decatons monitor the physical well-being of base modrons. Two stubby legs support their spherical bodies, and ten mechanical tentacles sprout out from their rounded frames in all directions. Their heads contain ten eyes to readily observe the operations of surrounding base modrons. In emergencies, a decaton can discharge a bolt of electricity from each of its ten eyes, synchronizing them to deadly effect.

## Modrons

Constructed on the plane of Mechanus, modrons are partially mechanical beings that belong to a strict hierarchy. Each modron dutifully obeys commands from the rank directly above it and in turn acts as the superior to the rank directly below it, passing down commands from paragons of law to the lowliest monodrone. While most modrons are the lower-ranked base modrons—monodrones, duodrones, tridrones, quadrones, and pentadrones—the upper-tier hierarch modrons hold leadership positions, maintaining order in Mechanus and the realms beyond. For more information on modrons, see the *Monster Manual*.
