# [Relentless Slasher](/bestiary/fiend/relentless-slasher-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 262*  

A relentless slasher pursues its prey with single-minded obsession. It conducts its bloody work in silence, then vanishes into shadow and infamy.

## Relentless Killers

*Pact-Bound Murderers*

Relentless killers are fiend-twisted maniacs that arise from mortals who make pacts with nefarious forces. Such killers' powers vary depending on their obsessions and the source of their powers.
