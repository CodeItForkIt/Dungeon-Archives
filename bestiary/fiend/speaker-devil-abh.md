*Devil of Spoken Compulsion*

Speaker devils are hulking, four-armed devils who discover the secrets of creatures they then compel to perform wicked deeds. Despite their large tongues, speaker devils speak with clear and pleasing voices. Among the ranks of the Nine Hells, they are known as logokrons.

Many speaker devils are loyal to the archdevil Mephistopheles. These devils record the secrets they uncover in Mephistar, Mephistopheles's vast library in Cania. While greedy to uncover other creatures' secrets, speaker devils diligently redact any evidence of their own secrets, lest such knowledge be used against them.
