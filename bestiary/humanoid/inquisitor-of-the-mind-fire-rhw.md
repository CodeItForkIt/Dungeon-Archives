# [Inquisitor of the Mind Fire](/bestiary/humanoid/inquisitor-of-the-mind-fire-rhw.md)
*Source: RHW p. 272*  

The Order of Cosima harnesses the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. Inquisitors of this order use their psychic powers to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. They represent their order with the symbol of a burning eye.

## Ulmist Inquisitors

*Zealous Vanquishers of Evil Intent*

"Evil lurks everywhere. With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it." With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to uncover and extinguish the wickedness lurking deep in people's hearts. From the depraved city of Malitain on the Material Plane, the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, reality-defying horrors, and the evil inherent to mortals. Sects of the inquisition exist within the Domains of Dread, working either in hidden cabals or infiltrating other faiths, such as the Church of Ezra.

The Ulmist Inquisition is organized into three orders named for Ulmed's companions: the Order of Cosima, the Order of Ansel, and the Order of Tristian. Each order specializes in a different psionic power, and each bears a different symbol on its coat of arms. Some inquisitors entertain friendly rivalries with their fellows from other orders, but most put aside their grudges—at least temporarily—to work together against evil.
