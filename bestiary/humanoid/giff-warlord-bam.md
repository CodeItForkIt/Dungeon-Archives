# [Giff Warlord](/bestiary/humanoid/giff-warlord-bam.md)
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 25*  

A high-ranking giff who takes up the life of an independent mercenary might amass enough power and influence to become a warlord.

A giff warlord usually commands a small fleet of spelljamming ships and operates out of a heavily defended stronghold. Anyone who shares the warlord's ideology—whatever it might be—is eligible to join the ranks of the warlord's army, which is mainly made up of mages who helm the ships of the fleet and provide magical firepower, sellswords of various species, and guns for hire in the form of giff shock troopers.
