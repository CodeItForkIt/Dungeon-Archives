# [Cultist of Bane](/bestiary/humanoid/cultist-of-bane-fraif.md)
*Source: Forgotten Realms: Adventures in Faerûn p. 254*  

Cultists of Bane sow strife, either by directly bullying others or by abusing existing power structures to create division and oppression. Although many cultists of Bane are tyrants capable of influencing large groups of lackeys, other cultists prefer to operate from the shadows. These cultists use their forceful personalities to counsel well-intentioned rulers, turning benign organizations into dictatorships and twisting leaders into tyrants. They tattoo Bane's symbol on their hands as a sign of devotion.

## Cultists

*Wicked Zealots of the Dead Three*

The adventurers Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul seized divinity but were slain for their hubris. All three have been reborn and are now known as the Dead Three. Each of the Dead Three has inspired wicked cults that follow their paths of tyranny, murder, and necromancy.

More than any other gods, the Dead Three directly influence Faerûn—and particularly the city of Baldur's Gate—in malign ways. Cultists who receive orders from their patron god directly are often the most ambitious and most dangerous.
