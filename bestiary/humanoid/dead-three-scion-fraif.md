## Dead Three Scion

*Inheritor of a Malevolent Deific Triumvirate*

Some wicked mortals have bound their souls to Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul and gained a portion of malevolent divine power from each. A scion of the Dead Three might have seized this power in a sinister ritual or had it thrust on them by an evil Artifact or a god's malevolent will. In any case, they possess cruelty, bloodlust, and necromantic power in equal measure and serve the Dead Three with their soul.

A Dead Three scion leads cults to Bane, Bhaal, or Myrkul—and often to all three. Sometimes the scion commands a single cult with an uneasy mix of adherents of each god, but a scion might lead separate cults from the shadows, playing them against each other and coordinating their efforts to bring the greatest amount of misery to a region.
