# [Tharashk Hunter](/bestiary/humanoid/tharashk-hunter-efa.md)
*Source: Eberron: Forge of the Artificer p. 85*  

House Tharashk's heirs include inquisitives, dragonshard prospectors, and bounty hunters. They are more at home in the trackless wilds than in crowded city streets, but they are quite capable of tracking and pursuing their prey in any environment.

Tharashk hunters, typically humans or orcs, often work alongside Druids of the Gatekeepers, and occasionally with Aberrant Cultists of the Dragon Below.
